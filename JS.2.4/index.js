// Open up the instructions first thing!

// Demonstrate a for loop
// We have a variable addTo. The user will be able to enter any Number
// to that variable. Create a for loop that loops 
// 10 times(0-9). Every time the loop runs add the iterator 
// to the addTo variable and assign the value to the addTo variable

// Note: The iterator is the variable you declare in parenthesis of
// the for loop. This variable is usually called 'i'.


let addTo;
function adding(myNum) {
  addTo = myNum;
  
  //write for loop here
  
  
}
