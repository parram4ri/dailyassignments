# Lists
Just like you saw in the videos there are a few different types of lists we can have in our HTML documents.

Lets use a couple of them here!

Go ahead and make an unordered list with at least 3 list items of some things you would like to accomplish in life before you die.
Once that is done make an ordered list with at least 3 list items of the process you take to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Perfect! You are a pro at making lists now! Run the tests then submit the assignments.
